# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Transformers

Unlock the power of sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using cutting-edge BERT-based Transformers. 
## Why Sentiment Analysis?

In a world where online reviews shape opinions, understanding sentiments is key. Yelp, a goldmine of user-generated content, poses both an opportunity and a challenge. This project harnesses the potential of sentiment analysis to extract meaningful information from the abundance of Yelp reviews.

## What Makes BERT Special?

BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is at the heart of this project. Its ability to capture bidirectional context revolutionizes sentiment analysis. We chose BERT for its effectiveness in understanding language nuances and context, providing a leap forward from traditional models.

## Key Objectives

1. **Sentiment Analysis for Yelp Reviews:** Implement techniques to categorize reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
2. **BERT-based Transformers:** Leverage the power of transformers to enhance sentiment classification accuracy.
3. **Thorough Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance on real-world Yelp reviews, measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## How It Works

### Data Preprocessing
Refine the Yelp review dataset with sentiment class mapping and text preprocessing by removing punctuation and stopwords to ensure high-quality input.

### Tokenization with BERT
Utilize the BERT tokenizer for breaking down text into smaller units, enhancing the analysis process.

### Model Architecture
Construct a robust sentiment analysis model on the BERT backbone, fine-tuned with FFN for Yelp reviews.

### Training and Evaluation
Fine-tune the model on Yelp reviews, continuously monitoring and selecting the best-performing model for evaluation on unseen data.
